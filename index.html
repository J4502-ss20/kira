<h3>Some nice things to have fun with and enjoy</h3>
<p>Two muffins were in an oven. One muffin says, “Man, it's hot in here.”
The other muffin says, “Oh my God, a talking muffin!”</p>
<p>That was a joke.</p>

  Here's a link so a really cool experimental web story about football and satellites, which I find inspirational as a web designer/storyteller.</a></p>

<h3>Sample paragraph</h3>
<p>No live organism can continue for long to exist sanely under conditions of absolute reality; even larks and katydids are supposed, by some, to dream. <span class="italic">Hill House</span>, not sane, stood by itself against its hills, holding darkness within; it had stood for eighty years and might stand for eighty more. Within, walls continued upright, bricks met neatly, floors were firm, and doors were sensibly shut; silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House, and whatever walked there, walked alone.</p>
